Let's use the R logo as an example image.

```{r, setup}
logo = file.path(R.home("doc"), "html", "logo.jpg")
file.copy(logo, 'R-logo.jpg')
```

Include the logo.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('R-logo.jpg')
```

Add a caption to it.

```{r, fig.cap='This is the R logo.'}
knitr::include_graphics('R-logo.jpg')
```

Set its width in the output.

```{r, out.width='30%'}
knitr::include_graphics('R-logo.jpg')
```

Include mutiple copies and place them side by side.

```{r, out.width='33%', fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('R-logo.jpg', 3))
```
