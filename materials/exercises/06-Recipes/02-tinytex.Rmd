## Install TinyTeX

Check if `tinytex:::is_tinytex()` returns `TRUE`. If not, you may install TinyTeX:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

## Manage LaTeX packages

You can use `tinytex::tlmgr_install()` and `tinytex::tlmgr_remove()` to install and remove LaTeX packages from TinyTeX (TeX Live), respectively. For example, we can remove two packages **framed** and **hyperref** here, and they will be automatically reinstalled because R Markdown documents are compiled to PDF through the R package **tinytex**:

```{r}
# usually you don't need this option unless you run into LaTeX trouble
options(tinytex.verbose = TRUE)

# intentionally remove two LaTeX packages
tinytex::tlmgr_remove(c('framed', 'hyperref'))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
