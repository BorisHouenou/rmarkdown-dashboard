title: Reading code from external files
---

The chunk option `code` takes a character vector, which will be the source code of the code chunk, e.g.,

```{r, code=c('# The code in this chunk was from the chunk option `code`', 'print("Hello code!")')}
```

Read a script into a code chunk:

```{r, code=readLines('19-code.R')}
```

Of course, you can also read Python scripts:

```{python, code=readLines('19-python.py')}
```

Read multiple chunks with `knitr::read_chunk()`:

```{r}
knitr::read_chunk('19-multiple.R')
```

Then use the code chunks with the appropriate labels, e.g.,

```{r, chunk-b}
```

```{r, chunk-a}
```
