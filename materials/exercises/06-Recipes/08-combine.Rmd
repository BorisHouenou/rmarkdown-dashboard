We have these variables in the `iris` dataset: `r knitr::combine_words(names(iris))`.

Quote the names: `r knitr::combine_words(names(iris), before = '"')`.

Put them in backticks: `r knitr::combine_words(names(iris), before = '\x60')`.

Put them in curly braces: `r knitr::combine_words(names(iris), before = '{', after = '}')`.
