# R Markdown

This is an R {~~markdown~>Markdown} document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown, {++ please ++} see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document, will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Dedoc Word

After rendering this Rmd document to Word, try to make some edits in Word, and run `redoc::dedoc()` on the Word file to regenerate the Rmd.

# Caution

DO NOT edit the parts that are automatically generated by R code, e.g., results from R code chunks. Typically you are expected to edit the narratives only.
