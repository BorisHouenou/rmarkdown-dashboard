title: Embed files in HTML output
---

With `xfun::embed_file()`, you can create a link on which your reader can click to download the file.

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
# make sure these packages are installed
xfun::pkg_load2(c('base64enc', 'htmltools', 'mime'))
```

```{r}
# embed the current Rmd source file
(f <- knitr::current_input())
xfun::embed_file(f)
```

```{r}
# embed a CSV file
write.csv(iris, 'iris.csv', row.names = FALSE)
xfun::embed_file('iris.csv', text = 'Click here to download iris.csv.')
unlink('iris.csv')
```

You can embed multiple files with `xfun::embed_files()` or an entire directory with `xfun::embed_dir()`. Please note that Windows users need the `zip` command, which is available if you have installed [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

```{r}
# check if you have `zip`
Sys.which('zip')
```
